Ever notice how a 4  year old's voice is louder than 200 adult  voices?
----------------------------
Several years ago, I returned home  from a trip just when a storm hit
with crashing thunder and severe lightning.  As I came into my bedroom
about 2 a.m., I found my two children in bed with  my ████, █████,
apparently scared by the loud storm. I resigned myself to  sleep in the
guest bedroom that night. The next day, I talked to the  children, and
explained that it was ████ to sleep with Mom when the storm was  bad, but
when I was expected home, please don't sleep with Mom that night.  They
said ok. After my next trip several weeks later, █████ and the  children
picked me up in the terminal at the appointed time. Since the plane  was
late, everyone had come into the terminal to wait for my  plane's
arrival, along with hundreds of other folks waiting for their  arriving
passengers. As I entered the waiting area, my son saw me, and came  running
shouting, "Hi, Dad! I've got some good news!" As I waved back, I  said
loudly, "What's the good news?" "Nobody slept with █████ while you were  away
this time!" ████ shouted. The
airport became very quiet, as everyone  in the waiting area looked at
████, then turned to me, and then searched the  rest of the area to see
if they could figure out exactly who█████Mom  was.
----------------------------
An acquaintance of mine who is a  physician told this story about her
then 4 yr. old ████████. On the way to  preschool, the doctor had left
her stethoscope on the car seat, and█████ little girl picked it up and
began playing with it. 'Be still, my heart,'  thought my friend, 'my ████████
wants to follow in my footsteps!'
Then the  child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's. May I
take your  order?"
-----------------
A certain little girl, when asked█████name,  would reply, "I'm ██.
██████████'s ████████." ██r ██████ told█████this was  wrong,█████must
say, "I'm ███████████████." The pastor spoke to█████in Sunday  School,
and said, "Aren't you ██. ██████████'s ████████?" ███ replied,  "I
thought I was, but ██████ says I'm not."
-----------------
A Sunday  school teacher asked█████little children, as they were on the
way to church  service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little  girl replied,"Because people are sleeping."
-----------------
At the  beginning of a children's sermon, one girl came up to the altar
wearing a  beautiful dress. As the children were sitting down around the
pastor,████ leaned over and said to the girl, "That is a very pretty
dress. Is it your  ██████ dress?" The girl replied almost directly into
the pastor's clip-on  ████, "Yes, and
my Mom says it's a bitch to  iron."
-----------------
And my personal favorite --- A little girl goes  to the barber shop with
her ██████. ███ stands next to the barber chair,  while█████dad gets his
hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her,  "Sweetheart,
you're gonna get hair on your ███████." ███ says, "Yes, I know,  and I'm
gonna get boobs too."
